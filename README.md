Edinson Quispe Carrasco – Systems Engineering Student
This website serves as a personal portfolio created with static web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and hosted via GitHub Pages. It presents a curated selection of my academic projects, technical capabilities, and relevant experience in the field of systems engineering.

I am currently in the 8th semester of my Systems Engineering degree at Universidad César Vallejo, with practical knowledge in MySQL, Java, C++, web development, and technical support. My professional experience includes hardware and software diagnostics, network configuration, system maintenance, and client-oriented technical services.

The purpose of this site is to centralize my work, highlight my technical competencies, and provide easy access to my resume, GitHub repositories, and professional contact information.

For further details or collaboration opportunities, please refer to the contact section or visit my LinkedIn profile.
